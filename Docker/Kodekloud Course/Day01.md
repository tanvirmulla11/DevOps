## ⚙️ What Can Docker Do?
Docker allows us to run each component of an application in **separate containers**, each with its **own dependencies and libraries** — all on the **same OS and VM** but within **isolated environments**.

Once Docker is installed and configured, developers can launch applications quickly using:
```bash
docker run <image_name>

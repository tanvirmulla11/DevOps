# ðŸš€ Day 10: Linux Bash Scripts â€“ KodeKloud 100 Days of DevOps

This repository contains my solution for **Day 10** of the [100 Days of DevOps Challenge](https://kodekloud.com/), focused on **Linux Bash Scripting**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Task Description
The production support team of *xFusionCorp Industries* is working on developing some bash scripts to automate different day-to-day tasks.  
One such requirement is to **create a bash script that prints the names of all users on the system**, along with their login shell.

---

## âœ… Solution

### Bash Script (`users_info.sh`)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script to list all system users with their login shell

echo "===== System Users and their Login Shells ====="
awk -F: '{ print $1 " -> " $7 }' /etc/passwd
```
---
## ðŸ”¹ Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x users_info.sh
```
## ðŸ”¹ Run the script
```bash
./users_info.sh
```
## ðŸ“‚ Sample Output
```bash
===== System Users and their Login Shells =====
root -> /bin/bash
daemon -> /usr/sbin/nologin
bin -> /usr/sbin/nologin
sys -> /usr/sbin/nologin
ubuntu -> /bin/bash
```

# üöÄ DevOps Day 17: PostgreSQL Database and User Management

Today's task was a dive into the world of database administration ‚Äî a critical skill for any DevOps role. The objective was to prepare a PostgreSQL database server for a new application. This wasn‚Äôt just about making sure the database was running; it was about setting up proper security and isolation for the new application's data.

I learned how to interact with PostgreSQL from the command line, create dedicated users and databases, and grant permissions. This entire process is a real-world application of the **Principle of Least Privilege** and is fundamental to building secure and maintainable systems.

## üß© The Task

The objective was to configure the pre-installed **PostgreSQL** server on the Nautilus database server. The specific requirements were:

1. Create a new database user (role) named `kodekloud_aim`.
2. Set a specific password (`ksH85UJjhb`) for this new user.
3. Create a new, empty database named `kodekloud_db6`.
4. Grant the `kodekloud_aim` user full permissions on the `kodekloud_db6` database.

## ‚öôÔ∏è My Step-by-Step Solution

The entire process was performed on the command line of the database server (`stdb01`).

### Step 1: Gaining Administrative Access
First, I connected to the database server and switched to the PostgreSQL administrative user.

```bash
ssh peter@stdb01
sudo -u postgres -i
psql
```
### Step 2: Executing the SQL Commands

### Inside the psql shell, I ran three SQL commands to accomplish the task.

```bash
-- Create the User
CREATE USER kodekloud_aim WITH PASSWORD 'ksH85UJjhb';

-- Create the Database
CREATE DATABASE kodekloud_db6;

-- Grant Permissions
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE kodekloud_db6 TO kodekloud_aim;
```
### Step 3: Verification

### While still inside psql, I verified my work using meta-commands.
```bash
\du   -- Check if the user was created
\l    -- Check databases and privileges
\q    -- Exit PostgreSQL
```
## After confirming, I exited the postgres user session ‚Äî successfully completing the task.
## üí° Why Did I Do This? (The What & Why)

### This task simulates a real-world DevOps scenario where a secure database environment must be prepared for an application. Proper user and privilege management in databases is vital for:

### Data isolation between services

### Preventing unauthorized access

### Easier maintenance and troubleshooting

## üîç Deep Dive: The Principle of Least Privilege in Databases

### The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) means giving users only the access they need ‚Äî nothing more.
### In databases, this minimizes risks such as:

### Accidental data deletion or modification

### Unauthorized data exposure

### Compromised accounts having full access

### By granting only essential permissions, we build a safer and more resilient system.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

### Forgetting to end SQL statements with a semicolon (;)

### Running commands without switching to the postgres user

### Granting privileges before the database or user exists

### Not verifying permissions after setup

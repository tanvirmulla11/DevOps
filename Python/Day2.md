# 🐍 Day 2 – Python Fundamentals

This document covers **Day 2 of Python learning**, focusing on **Virtual Environments** and **Python Data Structures**, specifically the **List** data structure.  
All examples are written clearly for beginners and practical understanding.

## 🔹 Virtual Environment in Python

A **virtual environment** is used to create an isolated Python workspace.  
It helps manage dependencies separately for each project and avoids version conflicts.

### 📌 Commands Used

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
deactivate
```
- python -m venv venv → Creates a virtual environment named venv

- activate.bat → Activates the environment (Windows)

- deactivate → Exits the virtual environment

## 🔹 Python Data Structures

### Python provides four main built-in data structures:

- List

- Dictionary

- Set

- Tuple

This session focuses on the List data structure.

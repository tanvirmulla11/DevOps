# Introduction to Shell Scripting

## What is Shell Scripting?

Shell scripting is writing a series of commands in a text file to automate tasks in a Linux/Unix shell (like bash). Think of it like writing a recipe: Instead of typing commands one-by-one, you save them in a `.sh` file, and run them all together.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, Connections!"
date
```

**Run it:**
1.  Save as `script.sh`
2.  Make it executable: `chmod +x script.sh`
3.  Run: `./script.sh`

## Who invented Shell Scripting?

Shell scripting wasn't "invented" by one person like a tool; it evolved with Unix.

Here's the key timeline:

* **Ken Thompson (1971):** Created the first Unix shell called `sh` (Bourne shell).
* **Stephen Bourne (1979):** Wrote the improved Bourne Shell (`sh`), which made scripting possible.

So, Stephen Bourne is mostly credited for popularizing shell scripting.

Later came other shells: `bash` (Bourne Again Shell), `zsh`, `ksh`, etc.

## Why is Shell Scripting important for DevOps?

Shell scripting is super important in DevOps because it helps automate stuff - which is what DevOps is all about.

Here's why it matters:

1.  **Automation:** Run builds, deployments, tests, cleanups all with one script.
2.  **CI/CD Pipelines:** Shell scripts are often used in tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI to automate pipelines.
3.  **Server Management:** Start/stop services, backup logs, check disk space easily scripted.
4.  **No Extra Tools Needed:** Works out-of-the-box on any Linux system (which most servers run).
5.  **Glue Language:** Connects tools like Docker, Git, Kubernetes, etc.

In DevOps, if you can't automate, you can't scale. Shell scripts = your automation superpower.

## How do I write and run my first shell script?

**Step 1: Create the script file**

Open terminal and type:
```bash
nano hello.sh
```

**Step 2: Write this code**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, Connections!"
date
```

Save & Exit (in nano): Press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

**Step 3: Make it executable**

```bash
chmod +x hello.sh
```

**Step 4: Run the script**

| Run           | Output                          |
| :------------ | :------------------------------ |
| `./hello.sh`  | `Hello, Connections!`           |
|               | `Sat Jun 14 16:05:00 IST 2025`  |

## What is `#!/bin/bash` and explain the syntax of the previous script?

Let's break down the script line-by-line:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, Connections!"
date
```

**Line 1: `#!/bin/bash`**
* Called **shebang**.
* Tells the system: "Use the Bash shell to run this script."
* If you skip it, the system might run your script with the wrong shell (like `sh`, `dash`, etc.).

**Line 2: `echo "Hello, Connections!"`**
* `echo` = prints text on the screen.
* `"Hello, Connections!"` = string being printed.
* **Output:** `Hello, Prashant!` (assuming "Connections!" was a typo or example for a name)

**Line 3: `date`**
* A built-in command that shows the current date and time.
* **Output:** e.g., `Sat Jun 14 16:10:45 IST 2025`

## What are variables in Shell Scripting and how to use them?

Variables store data like names, numbers, paths in the script to use later.

**Example Script with Variables:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

name="tanvir"
age=21

echo "My name is $name"
echo "I am $age years old"
```

**Syntax Rules:**
* No spaces around `=`.
    * ✅ `name="Tanvir Mulla"`
    * ❌ `name = "Tanvir Mulla"`
* To use a variable: add `$` before the name → `$name`.

**Output:**
```
My name is Tanvir
I am 21 years old
```

You can even take input like this:

```bash
read username
echo "Welcome, $username!"
```

## What are comments in Shell Scripting?

Comments are lines that explain the code - they're ignored by the shell.

**Syntax:**
```bash
# This is a comment
```

**Where to use:**
* Above commands to explain.
* In complex logic.
* To disable code (temporarily).

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This script greets the user

name="Prashant Gohel" # Storing name

echo "Hello, $name" # Printing greeting
```
Use comments wisely not for obvious stuff, but for clarity and logic.

## What is if-else in Shell Scripting?

`if-else` is used to make decisions like "if this is true, do that, else do something else."

**Basic Syntax:**

```bash
if [ condition ]
then
    # commands if true
else
    # commands if false
fi
```fi` = "if" reversed → marks the end of `if` block.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter your age:"
read age

if [ "$age" -ge 18 ]
then
    echo "You are an adult."
else
    echo "You are a minor."
fi
```

**Breakdown:**
* `read age` → takes user input.
* `[ "$age" -ge 18 ]` → checks if age `>= 18`.
* `-ge` = greater than or equal.

### Common operators:

| Operator | Meaning        |
| :------- | :------------- |
| `-eq`    | equal to       |
| `-ne`    | not equal to   |
| `-lt`    | less than      |
| `-le`    | less or equal  |
| `-gt`    | greater than   |
| `-ge`    | greater or equal |

## What is `elif` in Shell Scripting?

`elif` stands for "else if" and is used when you have multiple conditions to check, not just if and else.

**Syntax:**

```bash
if [ condition1 ]
then
    # do this
elif [ condition2 ]
then
    # do that
else
    # do something else
fi
```

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter your marks:"
read marks

if [ "$marks" -ge 90 ]
then
    echo "Grade: A+"
elif [ "$marks" -ge 75 ]
then
    echo "Grade: A"
elif [ "$marks" -ge 60 ]
then
    echo "Grade: B"
else
    echo "Grade: C or below"
fi
```
Use `elif` to avoid writing too many nested ifs. Cleaner and readable.

## What are loops in Shell Scripting?

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times – very useful for automation and repetition.

### Types of Loops in Shell Scripting

1.  **`for` loop**
    Runs for a fixed list or range of values.

    **Input:**
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    for i in 1 2 3 4 5
    do
        echo "Number: $i"
    done
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Number: 1
    Number: 2
    ...
    ```

2.  **`while` loop**
    Runs while a condition is true.

    **Input:**
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    count=1

    while [ "$count" -le 5 ]
    do
        echo "Count is: $count"
        count=$((count + 1))
    done
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Count is: 1
    Count is: 2
    ...
    ```

3.  **`until` loop**
    Runs until the condition becomes true (opposite of while).

    **Input:**
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    x=1
    until [ "$x" -gt 5 ]
    do
        echo "x is: $x"
        x=$((x + 1))
    done
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    x is: 1
    x is: 2
    ...
    ```

**Summary Table:**

| Loop   | Runs When...          | Use Case        |
| :----- | :-------------------- | :-------------- |
| `for`  | For each value in list | Known items/ranges |
| `while` | Condition is true     | Repeat till false |
| `until` | Condition is false    | Repeat till true |

## What are functions in Shell Scripting?

Functions are reusable blocks of code. You define them once and call them anytime.

**Syntax:**
```bash
function_name() {
    # code here
}
# or
function_name {
    # code here
}
```

**Example:**

**Input:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

greet() {
    echo "Hello, Connections!"
}

greet # Calling the function
```
**Output:**
```
Hello, Connections!
```

### Functions with arguments

**Input:**
```bash
say_hello() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}

say_hello "Tanvir"
```
**Output:**
```
Hello, Tanvir!
```

## What are arrays in Shell Scripting?

Arrays let you store multiple values in a single variable — super handy when dealing with lists!

1.  **Declare an Array**
    ```bash
    fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry")
    ```

2.  **Access elements**
    ```bash
    echo ${fruits[0]} # apple
    echo ${fruits[1]} # banana
    ```

3.  **Length of Array**
    ```bash
    echo ${#fruits[@]} # 3
    ```

4.  **Loop Through Array**
    ```bash
    for fruit in "${fruits[@]}"
    do
        echo "$fruit"
    done
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    apple
    banana
    cherry
    ```

5.  **Add elements**
    ```bash
    fruits+=("orange")
    ```

6.  **Remove elements:**
    You can't remove directly, but you can unset:
    ```bash
    unset fruits[1] # removes banana
    ```
Use arrays when working with multiple items like file names, user inputs, package lists, etc.

## What are Strings in Shell Scripting?

A string is just a sequence of characters — like text, names, paths, etc.

```bash
name="tanvir"
echo "Hello, $name"
```
**Output:**
```
Hello, tanvir
```

### String with spaces:

Always use quotes if your string has spaces:
```bash
greet="Hello World"
echo "$greet"
```

### String Operations

* **Length**
    ```bash
    echo ${#name} # 8
    ```
* **Concatenation**
    ```bash
    full="$name is learning Shell"
    echo "$full"
    ```
* **Compare Strings**
    ```bash
    if [ "$name" == "Prashant" ]; then
        echo "Match!"
    fi
    ```

## What is Substring in Shell Scripting?

A substring is a part of a string. You can extract it using `${variable:position:length}`.

**Syntax Example:**
`${string:start:length}`

```bash
str="DevOpsRocks"
echo ${str:0:6} # DevOps
echo ${str:6:5} # Rocks
```

**Breakdown:**
* `str`: variable name
* `0`: starting index (0-based)
* `6`: number of characters to extract

**Extract till end:**
```bash
echo ${str:6} # From index 6 to end → Rocks
```

Negative indexing isn’t supported directly:
Want last 2 chars? Use:
```bash
echo ${str: -2} # ks (space after `:` is required!)
```

## What is file handling in Shell Scripting?

File handling lets you read, write, or modify files directly from a script — super useful in DevOps automation.

1.  **Reading a File Line by Line**
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    filename="file.txt"
    while read line
    do
        echo "Line: $line"
    done < "$filename"
    ```
    **Example output for `file.txt` containing "Hello", "World", "Tanvir":**
    ```
    Line: Hello
    Line: World
    Line: Tanvir
    ```

2.  **Writing to a File**
    ```bash
    echo "This is a new line" > output.txt
    # Overwrites the file
    ```

3.  **Appending to a File**
    ```bash
    echo "Another line" >> output.txt
    # Adds to the end without deleting existing content.
    ```

4.  **Checking if File Exists**
    ```bash
    if [ -f "file.txt" ]; then
        echo "File exists"
    else
        echo "File not found"
    fi
    ```

## What are some useful keyboard shortcuts in Linux terminal?

Here are some powerful shortcuts to speed up terminal work:

| Shortcut   | Action                                   | Description                                         |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl + K` | Delete from cursor to end of the line    |                                                     |
| `Ctrl + U` | Delete from cursor to start of the line  |                                                     |
| `Ctrl + W` | Delete the word before the cursor        |                                                     |
| `Ctrl + R` | Search previous commands in history      |                                                     |
| `Ctrl + L` | Clear the terminal screen                | (same as `clear` command)                           |
| `Ctrl + S` | Pause output to the screen               |                                                     |
| `Ctrl + Q` | Resume output                            | (if paused with `Ctrl + S`)                         |
| `Ctrl + C` | Terminate the running command            |                                                     |
| `Ctrl + Z` | Suspend current command and send to background |                                                     |

These are very helpful when writing shell scripts or debugging — they save a lot of time!

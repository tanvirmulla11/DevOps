# Networking Short Notes for DevOps Engineers

Networking is a fundamental skill for DevOps engineers, as it directly impacts how applications are deployed, scaled, automated, and monitored. A strong understanding of networking concepts ensures that infrastructure and applications run efficiently, securely, and reliably across different environments.

## ## 1. Infrastructure Design

One of the core responsibilities of a DevOps engineer is designing and implementing infrastructure that supports software development and deployment. This includes:

- Setting up virtual networks and subnets  
- Configuring routers, switches, and firewalls  
- Ensuring secure and reliable connectivity between servers, services, and cloud components  
- Understanding network protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, DHCP, SSH, etc.)  
- Designing scalable and fault-tolerant network architectures  

**Why it matters:**  
Proper network design ensures high availability, low latency, and efficient communication across the infrastructure—critical for modern distributed systems.

## ## 2. Application Deployment

DevOps engineers handle the deployment of applications into production environments. Networking knowledge is essential for:

- Configuring servers and endpoint connectivity  
- Setting up load balancers (Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ELB) to distribute traffic  
- Managing ingress/egress in Kubernetes clusters  
- Ensuring secure communication between services  
- Troubleshooting connectivity issues during deployments  

**Why it matters:**  
Smooth deployments depend on well-configured network paths, correct routing, and secure communication channels.

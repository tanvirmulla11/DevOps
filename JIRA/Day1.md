# 📌 JIRA Basics – Agile Project Tracking Guide

A professional and beginner-friendly guide explaining **JIRA**, **Agile methodology**, **Scrum**, **Kanban**, and **issue types** commonly used in real-world projects.

## 🔹 What is JIRA?
**JIRA** is a project management and issue-tracking tool used to plan, track, and manage software development projects.

- Invented by **Atlassian**
- Widely used for **Agile project management**
- Helps teams track work, bugs, tasks, and progress

---
## 🔹 Why JIRA is Used?
- Track project progress
- Assign tasks to team members
- Follow Agile methodology
- Integrate with tools like **GitHub** and **Slack**
- Improve team collaboration and visibility

---
## 🔹 JIRA + Integrations

### ✅ JIRA + GitHub
- Automatically link commits to JIRA issues
- Track code changes for each task
- Improve traceability between code and work items

### ✅ JIRA + Slack
- Get real-time notifications in Slack
- Receive updates when issues are created, moved, or completed
- Faster communication between teams

---
## 🔹 Project Management Methodologies

### 🟦 Waterfall Model (Old Approach)
- Sequential process
- One task must be completed before starting the next
- No flexibility
- Not suitable for changing requirements

---

### 🟩 Agile Methodology (Modern Approach)
- Work is divided into small parts
- Flexible and iterative
- Continuous improvement
- Faster delivery and feedback

  ## 🔹 Scrum Framework

**Scrum** is an Agile framework where work is done in fixed time periods called **sprints**.

### Scrum Board Columns:
- **To Do**
- **In Progress**
- **Testing**
- **Done**

### Scrum Workflow:
1. Task added to **To Do**
2. Developer picks task → **In Progress**
3. Task tested → **Testing**
4. Completed task → **Done**

---

## 🔹 Kanban vs Scrum

| Feature | Scrum | Kanban |
|------|------|------|
| Time-bound | Yes (Sprints) | No |
| Sprint Planning | Required | Not required |
| Tracking | Detailed | Simple |
| Focus | Internal projects | Continuous flow |
| Task Visibility | Full workflow | Completed or not |

---

## 🔹 Sprint Explanation
- Sprint duration: **10–15 days**
- Sprint has **defined goals**
- Example Sprint:
  - Duration: **19 July – 29 July**
  - Goals:
    - Docker setup
    - Kubernetes setup
    - CI/CD basics

---

## 🔹 JIRA Issue Types

### 📘 Epic
- Large goal or objective
- Example: **Learn Docker**

### 📗 Story
- User requirement under an epic
- Example:  
  *As a DevOps engineer, I should learn Docker*

### 📕 Task
- Actual work to be performed
- Example:
  - Install Docker
  - Run basic containers

---

## 🔹 Story Point Estimation
Story points are used to estimate effort using the **Fibonacci series**:

**1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13**

| Story Points | Effort Estimate |
|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Few minutes |
| 3 | Few hours |
| 5 | Few days |
| 8 | One week |
| 13 | One month |

> ⚠️ Story points are based on **effort**, not exact time.

---

## 🔹 Sample Sprint (Example)

### Epic:
- **Learn DevOps Basics**

### Stories:
- Learn Docker fundamentals
- Understand Kubernetes basics

### Tasks:
- Install Docker (3 points)
- Run sample containers (2 points)
- Setup Kubernetes cluster (8 points)

> Note: Sprint planning is usually done by the **Project Manager**, but developers should understand the structure.

---

## 🔹 Backlog
- Backlog contains **unfinished or pending tasks**
- Tasks not completed in previous sprints move to the backlog
- Backlog is reviewed during sprint planning

---

## ✅ Conclusion
JIRA helps teams manage work efficiently using Agile practices like Scrum and Kanban. Understanding **epics, stories, tasks, sprints, and story points** is essential for working in modern software development teams.

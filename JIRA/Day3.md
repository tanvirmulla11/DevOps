## 📘 Story vs Epic in Jira

In Jira, **Stories** and **Epics** are both used to organize work, but they differ in **size, scope, and purpose**.

### 📝 Story
- A **Story** represents a small, specific piece of work
- It is usually completed within **one sprint**
- Stories are user-focused and written from the user’s perspective

**Example:**
> *As a user, I want to log in so that I can access my account.*

Stories are:
- Short-term
- Easy to estimate
- Assigned to individual team members

---

### 🧩 Epic
- An **Epic** is a large body of work
- It is broken down into **multiple stories**
- Epics usually span **multiple sprints**
- Used for managing complex features or large requirements

**Example Epic:**
> *Implement user authentication system*

**Stories under this Epic may include:**
- Create login page
- Set up database for user credentials
- Implement password reset feature
